          <h4> What is Javascript ?</h4>
          
          Javascript is a dynamic,interpreted and weakly typed programming langauge which was bulit with the purpose of running in host environment (e.g.inside of a webpage in the browser).
          <br>
          <br>

          It's part of pretty much any page you visit in the web as it's the only "thing" in web development that allows you (=the Developer) to change something on the page at runtime. Basically everytime something opens,close,moves or changes on the webpage,javascript will be involved.
          <br>
          <br>  
          There also at lot of webpages which are almost entirely powered by javascript (i.e.where a lot of the rendering work happens in the browser)-those pages typically use frameworks like angular ,but that's a topic wa'll cover later in the course.:-)
          <br>
